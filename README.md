# Data Cleaning Using SQL

In this project, I cleaned raw data from the Nashville housing market to be used for further analysis.Â 

### Cleaning Tasks

    1. Remove duplicated rows
    2. Populate PropertyAddress data where fields were null
    3. Breakout the PropertyAddress and OwnerAddress fields from a single column to multiple 
       columns for each address component (address, city, state)
    4. Standardize the SoldAsVacant fields from 'Yes', 'No', 'Y', and 'N' to just 'N' and 'Y'
    5. Covert SoldDate fields from Datetime to Date
    6. Remove unused columns
